## Submission Instructions

### Overview

Our group project will be a gift-giving event and wish list organizer.  Users will be able to invite other members to join gift giving events and each user will be able to make a wish list of gifts they would like to receive.  Users will be able to mark items on another user's wish list as purchased to avoid duplicate gifts, and purchases made on a specific wish list will be kept private from that list's creator.  This will benefit users by removing uncertainties in gift giving event; it will be clear who desires to receive what and who has alrleady purchased what for whom.  Other tools such as a shopping list generator will allow for a high level of organization.

### Features
-User login: users will be able to make an account and login to an account in order to save personal wish lists and create/join events.
-Authentication levels: different levels of authentication will determine what information a user has access to when viewing a wish list.  Namely, a user should not be able to see information about purchases made for themselves but should be able to see information regarding purchases for other users in a common event.
-Create event: users will be able to create events and invite other users to join the event.
-Create wish list: users will be able to create a personal wish list.
-Interact with wish list: users should be able to mark items as purchased after making a purchase on a wish list.
-User interaction: users will be able to invite other users to join an event. users will be able to view other user's wish lists.  users will be able to communicate with other     users to gain more information about gift preferences (e.g. shirt size, color preferences, etc.).  these communcations will remain anonymous.
-Create shopping list: users will be able to create a single shopping list by adding items from potentially many wish lists.


### Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- MySQL
- Hibernate
- Bootstrap 5
- Thymeleaf Templates / HTML & CSS

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn more about Spring Security to make sure certain information is only known by particular users.  Specifically, I will need to learn how to hide the purchased status from the owner of a wish list and I will need to learn how to hide the identity of a person asking a question.
